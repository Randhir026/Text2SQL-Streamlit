# Text2SQL-Streamlit
Text2SQL-Streamlit is a Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) search application that allows users to query a PostgreSQL database using plain English. The system translates user queries into SQL, executes them safely, and displays results through an interactive Streamlit interface. It also supports hybrid search using pgvector for semantic similarity.
